# Avocado.onToast ?

This project is designed to help people gain a better sense of their current financial status. By showing each user their personalised retirement age, we aim to emphasise how much of their lives they could be working for. Once a user can visualise how many years they have until retirement, we want to empower them to understand how small tweaks to their lifestyle now, can significantly shorten their road to total financial freedom. 

To run this project locally

- `npm install `
- `npm run knex migrate:latest`
- `npm run knex seed:run`
- `npm run dev`

Or checkout our deployed site at

## Learn More

On our home page you will see a series of questions that allows us to paint a basic picture of a user's financial status. The user can answer only these questions and we will calculate when we predict they will be able to retire. 

A user can then optionally answer more questions to get a more accurate retirement figure based on their habits. Once this information is shown, we allow the user to tweak their answers and we will present an updated retirement age. This is shown as a comparison to their original answers. This way a user can really see the difference that buying 1 less coffee a week could make. 

We have also built an option for users to add their own expenses, this displays in a table where the user can clearly see how much the item costs in terms of time. So buying 3 meals out per week for example may amount to 4 days per year of their total time.

To involve users further there is the ability for them to share a comment on the site. This could be their savings goal or what they have learned from the site and can include a rating.
