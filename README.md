# Avocado.onToast ?

This app is designed to help people gain a better sense of their current financial status. By showing each user their personalised retirement age, we aim to emphasise how much of their lives they could be working for. Once a user can visualise how many years they have until retirement, we want to empower them to understand how small tweaks to their lifestyle now, can significantly shorten their road to total financial freedom.

## Learn More

On our home page you will see a series of questions that allows us to paint a basic picture of your financial status. The user can answer only these questions and we will calculate when we predict they will be able to retire. 

A user can then optionally answer more questiions to get a more accurate retirement figure based on their habits. Once this information is shown, we allow the user to tweak their answers. This way they can really see the difference that buying 1 less coffee a week could make.
